Developers information
======================

The information on this page is meant for developers that want to change something about the Proteomics QC tool, send a patch with a bug fix or an improvement or are interested in finding out more about the development process in general. The Proteomics QC tool consists of two main parts: a modified version of the NIST MSQC pipeline and the Proteomics QC viewer, which provides a GUI for analyzing the QC reports produced by the pipeline.

We currently have some information on using GitHub & git and some information on the Checkstyle code style checker that we use for checking the Java code in the Proteomics QC viewer.


GitHub & git
------------

We are using [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) to manage the code of the Proteomics QC tool. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system, which makes it easy to work with a team on a collection of (source code) files. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system (see [GitHub on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) for more information).
