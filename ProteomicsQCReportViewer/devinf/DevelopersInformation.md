Developers information
======================

The information on this page is meant for developers that want to change something about the Proteomics QC tool, send a patch with a bug fix or an improvement or are interested in finding out more about the development process in general. The Proteomics QC tool consists of two main parts: a modified version of the NIST MSQC pipeline and the Proteomics QC viewer, which provides a GUI for analyzing the QC reports produced by the pipeline.
