Note of parameters:
dataRangeControl = 1, given retention time (RT in second) and m/z ranges by user
                 = 2, this program automatically search the major concerned RT and m/z ranges, with including >98% identified unique peptide ions.
                 = 3, this program automatically search the major concerned RT and m/z ranges, with including 100% identified unique peptide ions.
                 = 4, including whole ranges of RT and m/z of the run.

minIncludedRT - Start RT (s). If dataRangeControl = 1, the program will use the value provided by the user, otherwise, the program will find it automatically.
maxIncludedRT - End RT (s). If dataRangeControl = 1, the program will use the value provided by the user, otherwise, the program will find it automatically.
LowestAllowedMZ - The smallest concerned m/z value. If dataRangeControl = 1, the program will use the value provided by the user, otherwise, the program will find it automatically.
HighestAllowedMZ - The largest concerned m/z value. If dataRangeControl = 1, the program will use the value provided by the user, otherwise, the program will find it automatically.

matchScoreThreshold - If a peptide ion match score is less than this value, it won't be dealt with as an identified peptide ion.

LTQ peakIntensityThreshold - Threshold LTQ instrument. If a peak's relative intensity is less than this value, this peak won't included in calculation.
Orbi peakIntensityThreshold - Threshold Orbitrap instrument. If a peak's relative intensity is less than this value, this peak won't included in calculation.
