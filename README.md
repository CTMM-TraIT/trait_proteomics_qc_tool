TraIT Proteomics QC Tool
========================

As part of the CTMM TraIT project, the Netherlands Bioinformatics Institute (NBIC) and VUmc OncoProteomics Laboratory (OPL) have adapted the NIST MSQC Pipeline and developed QC Report Viewer tool to suit the proteomics QC requirements of the OPL lab. The adapted pipeline is called the Proteomics QC Pipeline. Compared to the NIST MSQC Pipeline, the adapted version triggers pipeline processing on the availability of a new RAW data file in a fully automatic fashion and creates a QC report combining the NIST metrics with a number of custom metrics. The Proteomics QC Report Viewer aggregates and shows all available QC reports from the QC pipeline report directory. It includes functionality of sorting, filtering, zooming and comparing these reports as per the need of proteomics researchers. Together, the Proteomics QC Pipeline and QC Report Viewer are called the TraIT Proteomics QC Tool.
